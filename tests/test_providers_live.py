"""Opt-in live smoke tests against the real vendor APIs — skipped unless
the matching credentials are present in the environment.

These exist because tests/test_providers.py mocks the SDK client, which
verifies rag-gate's request-building logic but not that the vendor's
*current* SDK still accepts that request — see docs/adr/0004, which was
written after exactly that kind of drift broke the Anthropic provider
silently past the mocked tests. Never run in default CI: no vendor
credentials are configured there. Run locally with the relevant API key
exported to catch this class of drift before a release.
