"""Runnable demo: a compliance Q&A bot that only answers from policy
documents, with every claim cited back to a specific one.

Run with (from the repository root, after `uv sync`):

    uv run python examples/compliance_qa/demo.py

No API key needed — this demo runs entirely offline with the dependency-
free `HashingEmbedder` and shows rag-gate's two core guarantees:

1. A documented question retrieves real chunks from the indexed policy.
2. An undocumented question is refused *before* any LLM would be called —
   the exact behavior that matters most in a compliance context, where an
   invented answer is a liability, not just a bad user experience.

Set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY to also see a real, cited LLM answer for the
documented question.
