"""The VectorStore interface every retrieval backend implements.

See docs/adr/0001-domain-agnostic-core.md — rag-gate's core depends only
on this Protocol, never on a specific vector database's client. A
VectorStore deals in already-computed vectors, not raw text: embedding is
the caller's (or the retriever's) job via an Embedder, which keeps the
store swappable independently of the embedding backend.
