# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in `rag-gate`. The core, CLI, and two runnable
examples (Phases 0-2) are implemented and tested — see
[`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) for what's done and what's
next. Packaging and launch (Phases 3-4) are still ahead, so the project
isn't taking large external contributions yet, but feedback, bug reports,
and small fixes are welcome.

Good places to help right now:

- `stores/pgvector.py` and `stores/qdrant.py` are typed stubs — a real
  implementation with a docker-compose-based integration test would be
  very welcome.
- `tests/test_providers_live.py` only covers Anthropic and OpenAI — an
  equivalent opt-in smoke test against a local Ollama server would close
  the gap (see `docs/adr/0004` for why these exist).
- Anything in `docs/adr/` you disagree with — open an issue with the
  alternative and the trade-off.

## Development setup

```bash
# Skips sentence-transformers on purpose — it pulls in a multi-GB PyTorch
# download. Add --extra sentence-transformers if you're touching that file.
uv sync --extra dev --extra anthropic --extra openai --extra ollama --extra chroma --extra pdf
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check .
uv run mypy src/rag_gate
```

## Adding a new provider / store / embedder

Implement the relevant `Protocol` in `providers/base.py`, `stores/base.py`,
or `embeddings/base.py`. Import the vendor SDK lazily (inside `__init__` or
the method that needs it, not at module level) and raise `ImportError` with
a message naming the extra to install — see any existing implementation
(e.g. `providers/anthropic.py`) for the pattern. Add the SDK as a new
optional dependency in `pyproject.toml`, and mock the SDK client in tests
rather than calling the real API (see `tests/test_providers.py`).

## Commit style

This project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
(`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, …) to keep the changelog generatable.
