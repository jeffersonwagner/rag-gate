"""Hallucination-rate benchmark: what happens to an out-of-scope question
with and without the documentary gate.

Run with (from the repository root, after `uv sync`):

    uv run python scripts/benchmark.py

Offline by default — no API key needed. It measures the one thing that's
objectively countable without judging answer quality: on questions with NO
matching documentation, how often does each pipeline produce an answer
anyway, instead of refusing?

    naive pipeline   (no gate): always retrieves the closest chunk it has
                                 and always calls the LLM from it, however
                                 unrelated that chunk actually is
    rag-gate pipeline (gated): refuses before ever calling the LLM when
                                 coverage is missing

Set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY to also see one live example of what the naive
pipeline's LLM actually says when generated from unrelated context.
